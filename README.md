Deep Learning Model for Melon Growth Stage Classification Using RGB Image.

This is the code hub which have a deep-learning-based melon growth stage classification model. 

This repo have two types of the model: ML(Machine Learning) and DL(Deep Learning)

ML is light-weight to train, so it is proper to implement in edge computing or training in the field which has different condition to the original dataset.
DL is heavy-weight to train, but it shows greater performance. 
There are four types of the ML model
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest

There are four types of the DL model
1. CNN (Simple Structure)
2. CNN (More Complicative Structure)
3. ResNet
4. VGG-16
