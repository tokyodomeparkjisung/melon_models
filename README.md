# melon_models
Deep Learning Model for Melon Growth Stage Classification Using RGB Image.

This is the code hub which have a deep-learning-based melon growth stage classification model. 

There are four types of the model
1. CNN (Simple Structure)
2. CNN (More Complicative Structure)
3. ResNet
4. VGG-16
